            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Seven Deadly Sins are a band of knights in the land of Britannia (ブリタニア, Buritania) who had disbanded ten years earlier after being framed for plotting a coup against the Liones Kingdom (リオネス王国, Rionesu Ōkoku), the Holy Knights who sequestered them before taking control in the wake of a rebellion they organized. Liones' third princess, Elizabeth Liones, finds the Seven Deadly Sins' leader, Meliodas, before they track down his comrades so they can clear their names and liberate Liones from the Holy Knights, who were manipulated by a demon named Fraudrin into unsealing the Demon Race from their prison.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-top: 13px;">Meliodas is the Dragons Sin of Wrath and the leader of the group known as the Seven Deadly Sins. 
                    He is the main protagonist of the manga Nanatsu no Taizai and the owner of the Boar Hat bar. His past is still in shambles since Meliodas somehow lost fragments of his memory from the past only remembering bits and pieces.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-top: 13px;">Very little is known of Elizabeth's childhood or what led up to her being adopted by Liones's king. 
                        As a child, she was often seen playing with soon-to-be Holy Knights and her two adopted sisters. After the Holy Knights staged a coup and overthrew the kingdom she escaped the castle in rusting armor in search of the Seven Deadly Sins believing they were the only ones that could match the Holy Knights' strength and defeat them. </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-top: 13px;">Ban is the Fox's Sin of Greed, of the Seven Deadly Sins. 
                            He encountered the keeper of the Fountain of Youth from the Fairy King's Forest, Elaine, who died and insisted to give him the Fountain of the Youth to him on her deathbed after the forest got intruded by a Red Demon. 
                            Hence, he was known to be as the Undead Ban. Afterwards, he was then accused for causing ruination of the forest and the demise of Elaine yet couldn't be executed regardless of what methods were used. </p>
