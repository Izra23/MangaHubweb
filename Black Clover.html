            <p style="text-align: justify;">Asta and Yuno are orphans raised in the outskirts of the Clover Kingdom. In a world where people are born with magic, Asta was born without any. In contrast, Yuno was born a prodigy with above average magic power and the talent to control it. Additionally, in their coming of age ceremony, Yuno receives a rare four-leaf clover grimoire, like the original Wizard King. On the other hand, Asta received a tattered grimoire where a devil lies within, a five-leaf clover grimoire.

                The story follows Asta and Yuno as they crawl their way up the ladder of the Clover Kingdom's Magic Knights, in the midst of scrutiny by the nobles, to become the Wizard King. However, the title is only preserved for a single mage. Who will attain the coveted title of the strongest mage in the kingdom, Asta or Yuno?</p>
